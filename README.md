## TODO

I have created this sample layout for calculator app. You can copy and paste this layout in your project or make your own.

## Functional Requirments

Calculator app need to perform following functions

> Add two provided numbers on clicking Add (+) button and show result.

> Subtract two provided numbers on clicking Subtract (-) button and show result.

> Multiply two provided numbers on clicking Multiply (x) button and show result.

> Divide two provided numbers on clicking Divide (/)  button and show result.

> Give Remainder of two provided numbers on clicking Mod (%) button and show result.

> Clear the entered text in both editText on clicking CLR button

## Hints

First make on clicks for each button viz add , subtract , multiply , divide , mod and clear.

Make reference of both edittexts in java file by using findViewById() function beacuse we need to read the input of edittexts.

Make reference of Answer TextView in java file by using findViewById() function because we are showing answer from java file.

Read the two inputs and perform arithmatic operation according to on which button click that function is working . For example for onclick function of add button perform addition and so on.

After calculating answer show answer in layout using setText() function on answer text view.

### For clearing the edittext use below code

`edittext.setText("");` editext will be the name of the EditText object in java for which you want to clear text.

by using above line entered text in editText will be cleared. Use this in onclick function of CLR button.
